  '''
1. Purpose of Collecting Facial Data:

Our app collects facial data through the device's camera for the following purposes:

* Identity Verification:

￮ If you use real-person facial recognition, we collect your photos and facial recognition videos with your approval. This is to compare the uploaded photos with the video, ensuring the authenticity of your identity and preventing account theft or misuse.

* Special Effects, Beautification, and Filters:

￮ When you use certain features to create special effects or emojis for your livestream or uploaded pictures on Lumo, we provide beautification and facial filter functions during your livestream.

* Content Safety:

￮ During your livestream, we capture segments of your stream to automatically detect and identify inappropriate content, ensuring compliance with platform standards.

Note: This data is only collected when users actively enable the related functions.

2. Storage and Duration of Facial Data:

* Local Storage:

￮ Facial data is processed and stored locally on the device. Data is not uploaded to external servers, and we employ advanced encryption techniques to protect data during storage.

* Temporary Storage Duration:

￮ Facial data is temporarily stored only during the use of the function. Once processing is complete (e.g., applying a filter or completing verification), the data is immediately deleted. We ensure that facial data is not stored for extended periods in the app.

* Continuous Storage:

￮ For certain functions (e.g., saving processed images), only with explicit user consent, processed images are stored in the local album, not the original facial data.

Note:

For facial data during livestreams, we use it in real-time without storing it.

For real-person authentication data, it is retained until you request deletion or modification of your personal information, or within 60 days after your account is deleted (whichever comes first). This duration considers the possibility of users wanting to recover their account information, with the maximum recovery period being 60 days.

3. User Control and Data Deletion:

We respect users' control over their facial data. Users can delete any processed images or disable related functions at any time. All temporary facial data will be automatically deleted when users terminate the function.

* Encryption:

￮ All facial data is encrypted during processing and storage to ensure it cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.

* Compliance:

￮ We strictly adhere to Apple's developer guidelines and relevant privacy regulations to ensure the safety of user data.
